# carzone
In this Project, we have a website that can be used as a site for selling cars(with different conditions) depending upon the need of the customers. I have build this website with the help of a Udemy course "Build Python Django Real Project". The site is build using Django. The site is hosted using Heroku. It can be viewed here: https://carzone-app.herokuapp.com/
